from the inequality 108 227 we are likely to conclude that we can represent 8-digit decimal floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit floating-point numbers however we need 28 significant bits to represent some 8-digit numbers accurately in general we can show that if 10p 2q-1 then q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimal accuracy finally we can define a compact significant bits for numbers of practical importance cacm february 1967 goldberg i b ca670208 jb february 28 1978 238 pm
