increasing the efficiency of quicksort a method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations of quicksort the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log2n a formula is derived expressing a in terms of the probability distribution of the bound of a partition this formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already considered by hoare namely choice of the bound as median of a random sample the main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound this generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program a numerical approximation shows that a 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with cacm september 1970 van emden m h sorting quicksort information content entropy distribution of median ca700908 jb february 10 1978 1015 am
