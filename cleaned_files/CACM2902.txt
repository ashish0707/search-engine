dynamic memory allocation in computer simulation this paper investigates the performance of to service simulation programs as represented by 18 test cases algorithm performance was measured in terms of processing time memory usage and external memory fragmentation algorithms main taining separate free space lists for each size of memory block used tended to perform quite well compared with other algorithms simple algorithms operating on memory ordered lists without any free list performed surprisingly well algorithms employing power-of-two block sizes had favorable processing requirements but generally unfavorable memory usage algorithms employing lifo fifo or memory ordered free lists generally performed poorly compared with others cacm november 1977 nielsen n r algorithm performancedynamic memory allocation dynamic memory management dynamic storage allocation garbage collection list processing memory allocation memory management programming techniques simulation simulation memory management simulation techniques space allocation storage allocation ca771114 jb december 27 1977 609 am
