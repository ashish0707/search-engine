power trees the new class of pk trees is presented where height balance is maintained for the nodes iying on particular paths the number of nodes of a pk tree asymptotically grows as a power of the height in the worst case a procedure for node insertion is given and the class of trees considered is restricted to ipk trees which are buildable by such a procedure the average behavior of such trees studied by an extensive set of simulation runs is close to that of avl trees in particular the family of ipo trees whose main advantage is the reduced number of restructurings required after node insertion is analyzed cacm november 1978 luccio f pagli l binary search trees pk trees ipk trees search length node insertion subtree rotation ca781109 dh january 25 1979 429 pm
