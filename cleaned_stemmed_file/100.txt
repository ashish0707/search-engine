reaction it is necessari to correct the temperatur data for transient heat conduct loss in a cylindr calorimet to handl the complex aris from vari thermal relax time of concentr insul layer a comput program wa develop which give the temperatur distribut of the system as a function of radiu and time thi distribut is correct at each step by a subroutin which calcul the instantan chemic state of there action as well as the heat produc by thi reaction the program is base on a direct statement of fourier s law of heat conduct and the chemic rate equat to provid a bookkeep law to follow the reactant and the flow of heat packet in such a wai that the comput continu store the heat distribut a comput analysi method is here regard as on in which the physic law of a process ar us explicitli
