it is in fact easi to learn algol and to write algorithm in it the languag is so gener and power it can handl an enorm class of problem it is not hard to learn those part of algol present in other compil languag how to write assign and go to and for statement etc inde a lot of the unnecessari restrict impos by other compil languag have final been lift but algol also allow mani unobvi thing to be written as we will see later and herein li a problem algol seem to have becom too gener so mani restrict have been lift that a lot of technic detail crop up which ar hard to learn and to us
