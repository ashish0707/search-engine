parallel method for integr ordinari differenti equat thi paper is dedic to the proposit that in order to take full advantag for real time comput of highli parallel comput as can be expect to be avail in the near futur much of numer analysi will have to be recast in a more parallel form by thi is meant that serial algorithm ought to be replac by algorithm which consist of sever subtask which can be comput without knowledg of the result of the other subtask as an exampl a method is propos for parallel the numer integr of an ordinari differenti equat which process by all standard method is entir serial cacm decemb 1964 nievergelt j ca641221 jb march 9 1978 3 09 pm 950 5 950 950 5 950 950 5 950 ration chebyshev approxim to the bessel function integr ki x the second reme algorithm is us to approxim the integr ki by ration function the relat coeffici for the approxim of ki1 ki2 ki3 ar given for differ precis cacm decemb 1964 gargantini i pomental t ca641220 jb march 9 1978 3 12 pm 1015 4 951 1346 4 951 1440 4 951 1645 4 951 951 4 951 951 5 951 951 5 951 951 5 951 1346 5 951 532 5 951 951 6 951 532 6 951 anoth us of fortran ii chain cacm decemb 1964 drath d g ca641219 jb march 9 1978 3 13 pm 952 5 952 952 5 952 952 5 952 scan text with a 1401 cacm decemb 1964 baker j j ca641218 jb march 9 1978 3 13 pm 953 5 953 953 5 953 953 5 953 2870 5 953 953 6 953 2377 6 953 2632 6 953 a note on the calcul of probabl in an f distribut cacm decemb 1964 smilli k w anstei t h ca641217 jb march 9 1978 3 14 pm 954 5 954 954 5 954 954 5 954 a class of matric to test invers procedur cacm decemb 1964 cline r e ca641216 jb march 9 1978 3 16 pm 955 5 955 955 5 955 955 5 955 a famili of test matric cacm decemb 1964 newberi a c r ca641215 jb march 9 1978 3 17 pm 956 5 956 956 5 956 956 5 956 method for partial rewrit of magnet tape cacm decemb 1964 miller j a ca641214 jb march 9 1978 3 18 pm 957 5 957 957 5 957 957 5 957 a case of too much precis cacm decemb 1964 syng m j ca641213 jb march 9 1978 3 23 pm 958 5 958 958 5 958 958 5 958 mark sens and port a punch program input cacm decemb 1964 lubbert w f ca641212 jb march 9 1978 3 24 pm 959 5 959 959 5 959 959 5 959
